# Chess-tournament-manager
This is a simple swiss chess style tournament manager

Open the application file to start the tornament manager (form design.exe) you may have to clear the files, on the last tab click clear file before starting. 
This tournament manager saves the information of the players and rounds. 
so you can quit this manager and the information will still save There are a few bugs, it may pair the same people twice. But it will always pair people on similar points.

This was made using the windows forms app for visual studio. You can change the manager and make it better as you see fit. This is all the code for it. This was a computing project for the NEA I did in scchool.
